        <p>Allan is the name and I consider myself a curious individual starting to get his feet wet in the vast 
            ocean of software developing. Graduated with Bachelors in Business Economics at the University of
            California, Irvine in 2016 and is currently holding a full-time position as a Business Analyst under the Product 
            Management team at Banc of California HQ. I was also fortunate enough to enroll in a full-stack coding bootcamp
            as part-time student. My future vision of myself is to be a work-from-home dad that held notable web development
            and software development positions which allowed myself to be in the comfort of his own home to work. 
            Outside of responsibilities, I enjoy binge watching shows and spending quality time with my family and friends.
